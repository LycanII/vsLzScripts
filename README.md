# Lazy Scripts

## An Sql Script Generator for VsCode

A simple script generator for lazy devs like moi ðŸ˜Š.
It generates `INSERT` queries from a `SELECT` statement. This is a ported version of the original extension for Azure Data Studio ([LzScripts](https://github.com/LycanII/LzScripts)).

### How to Use

In the editor, simply select, right-click on the SQL script and click on the `Generate Insert from Result` context menu, Select `To Clipboard` or `To New Tab` to generate query to the clipboard or a new tab respectively.

### Note

* â˜• Fueled by questionable amounts of caffeine and a weekend's worth of determination, this extension came to life in a glorious sprint. If it hiccups, glitches, or throws a tantrum, donâ€™t be shy, open an issue and give it a gentle nudge back to sanity. Bugs happen, but together we squash them.
* Currently supports only `MSSQL`.
* Supports any database schema if added.
* Uses the first table it finds after the `from` clause in your select query as the target table for Insert. So `select * from table` and `select * from databaseName.dbo.table` is supported. See below for more examples.
* Generates a single insert with multiple values by default, you can disable this behavior, via the settings page, `Ctl+,`. Under the `Extensions > LzScripts`, section enable Allow Insert Per Row.
* ðŸš€ Heads up! This extension currently taps into `connectionSharing.connect(...)` from the mighty [vscode-mssql API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mssql). That means it dives straight into the server-level poolâ€”yep, the default landing spot is usually the master database. But donâ€™t worry, youâ€™ll get a friendly popup inviting you to pick the database you actually want to work with. We're keeping our eyes peeled for a slicker workaround, so this behavior might evolve in future updates. Stay tunedâ€”smarter connections are on the horizon!


#### Examples of possible scripts supported

`plain old joins`

```[SQL]
select t1.* from table1 t1
inner join table2 t2 on t1.ItemID  = t2.ItemID
where t1.ItemID = 10 
```

`with subqueries`

```[SQL]
select t1.* from table1 t1
where t1.ItemID in (
  select top (20) t2.ItemID from table2 t2 
) 
```
